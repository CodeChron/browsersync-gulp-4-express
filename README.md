# Setting up Browsersync with Gulp 4 and Express

This is a basic setup for live reload of your browser when working with [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/), [Gulp 4](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0) and [Express].

- Clone and cd into this repo
- ```npm install```
- ```gulp```
- make changes to files in src and see updates reflected in the browser.
